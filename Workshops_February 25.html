All are welcome to join us in hacking toys and adapting them for use with an assistive switch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      An assistive switch helps individuals with limited mobility interact with electronic devices. It typically consists of a switch/button mechanism that can be connected to assistive technology devices, but in this workshop? It’s toys! Commercially adapted products can run upwards of $300. However, with a bit of tinkering, we can switch-adapt toys and make them accessible for a fraction of the cost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      *Please note, capacity for this event is limited to the first 20 registrants.

                  <p><em>(Coordinated by Bridges to Adelphi, College of Arts and Sciences, Faculty Center for Professional Excellence)</em></p>
                    <h3>Multiple Dates</h3>

                    <p>
                      In this workshop, we will hear directly from neurodivergent students who will be sharing their experiences in the classroom to further encourage understanding of the needs of neurodivergent students and to give faculty members clear tools to use to work more successfully with neurodivergent students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Faculty have found it beneficial to directly hear from students as this can help us understand ways to promote neurodiversity and inclusion in various spaces including the classroom.

                The mission of the Faculty Center (FCPE) is to foster a culture of academic excellence, inclusive pedagogy and professional growth for all faculty.
              </p>
              <p>
                We host an annual teaching and learning conference, monthly workshops and intensives, as well as one-on-one consultations to solve specific teaching challenges. The Faculty Center partners with instructors to identify and implement evidence-based practices and technology into teaching. The FCPE also connects faculty to resources and strategies to pursue meaningful scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL).
