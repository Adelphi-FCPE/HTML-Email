              <h2>2nd Call! - Boost Your Writing Productivity: Accountability and Peer Support Opportunities</h2>
              <p>In December, we sent all the following and received an outstanding reply! Shortly, we will be reaching out to all interested and putting together our groups. To share your interest, please complete the form below by Monday, February 3rd. …</p>
              <p>Managing your writing projects, alongside the many other responsibilities you have, can be challenging whether or not there’s a pressing deadline. To help faculty meet their writing goals, the FCPE is offering two key initiatives:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Writing Accountability Groups</strong>: These groups provide faculty with dedicated time and a structured, supportive space to focus on their writing. Open to faculty across disciplines, participants work on a variety of projects, including grant submissions, research articles, tenure materials, or creative writing pieces. Through bi-weekly, synchronous Zoom (and/or in-person) sessions, faculty can build momentum and productivity while benefiting from a consistent and focused writing environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Writing Peer Review and Support Groups</strong>: Designed for faculty seeking collaborative feedback on writing projects, including grant proposals, these bi-weekly groups (held synchronously via Zoom and/or in-person) offer a facilitated environment for peer support. Participants receive constructive insights and encouragement from their colleagues, helping them refine their work and overcome challenges.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Whether you’re looking for uninterrupted writing time or collaborative feedback, these initiatives foster a culture of productivity and mutual support among faculty writers. Let’s make academic writing more focused, collaborative, and rewarding!</p>

                 <h2>Empathy in Education: The Compassionate Teacher's Toolkit</h2>
                 <p>As the landscape of higher education continues to evolve, so too must our approach in interacting with our students. The Pandemic opened the door; institutions and educators became more aware of the diverse needs of our students, leading to increased inclusivity in our courses. Since then, the changing landscape has emphasized the need for iterative evaluation in how we relate to students, with a focus on a foundation of kindness and understanding to ensure the success of all students. “Compassionate Teaching” becomes paramount in recognizing and addressing the varied needs of students, fostering inclusivity, and adapting to the evolving challenges within higher education.</p>
                 <p>In navigating this shift, educators can <a href="https://flourishingacademic.wordpress.com/2021/11/22/the-compassionate-classroom/#:~:text=Balancing%20academic%20rigor%20with%20compassion,can%20actually%20promote%20academic%20rigor" target="_blank">maintain course rigor and uphold standards of excellence</a> by thoughtfully designing instruction and assessments, integrating the principles of Compassionate Teaching. Critical thinking about the best ways to support students remains crucial.</p>
                 <p><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/campus/collections/teaching-compassion" target="_blank">Compassionate Teaching</a> is a philosophy emphasizing the well-being and individual needs of students. To embody this philosophy, educators must consider not only extrinsic motivators such as grades but intrinsic motivators that ignite curiosity and facilitate understanding. Effective course design and classroom practices play a role in achieving this objective. Students must know that they are supported and valued throughout their learning process.</p>
                 <p>Consider implementing the following practices:</p>

                 <h2>1. Facilitate/Foster Open Communication</h2>
                 <p>Effective communication is a cornerstone of Compassionate Teaching, serving as perhaps its most crucial component. Proactively engaging struggling students through emails creates a supportive bridge, where instructors can offer timely assistance. This not only makes students feel supported but also cultivates intrinsic motivation. Providing assistance before challenges become insurmountable can significantly impact a student’s performance in the class. Furthermore, encouraging communication both during and outside of class hours establishes a sense of community, through which students feel heard and valued. Instructors express delight when students participate in class discussions and disappointment when they don't. Praising student participation and expressing gratitude serve as powerful tools to foster a positive atmosphere, often leading to the robust and open discussions that instructors desire.</p>
                 
                 <h2>2. Flexibility in Assignments</h2>
                 <p>A cornerstone of Compassionate Teaching lies in providing flexibility in assignments. Students feel valued and supported when they believe that they have some <a href="https://www.apa.org/education-career/k12/learners#:~:text=When%20students%20understand%20their%20role,some%20actual%20choice%20and%20control" target="_blank">autonomy</a> in their learning. One way to support this is for instructors to <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/" target="_blank">offer choices in assessments</a>, allowing students to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-j3HYlxKFDGcLaWYJrsYYBzPJKLclXIHNN88Q0HdLhI/copy" target="_blank">demonstrate their understanding</a> in ways that resonate with their strengths. For example, instructors can offer students reading assignments that give them the option to choose ones that they find both interesting and accessible while still meeting the learning objectives.</p>
                 <p>Another way to provide flexibility and a sense of autonomy is to drop the lowest grade. Doing so, not only serves as a safety net for students, it serves as an acknowledgement that not every student excels under the same conditions which cultivates a sense of support on the part of the instructor. When students feel supported, they are more likely to be intrinsically motivated.</p>
                 <p>A final way for instructors to provide flexibility is to permit multiple submissions, particularly for written assignments. This practice nurtures a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isHM1rEd3GE" target="_blank">Growth Mindset</a>” (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/growth-mindset" target="_blank">summary of Growth Mindset</a>) and stresses the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-swZaKN2Ic" target="_blank">Power of Yet</a>,” valuing the learning process over perfection as this practice provides students the opportunity to reflect on what they can do to improve a prior submission rather than complacently accept a lower grade. This also instills a sense of autonomy as students get the choice of whether they want to improve their grade or accept the original one that was given to them.  Providing feedback on such assignments that scaffold a better performance on a subsequent submission further promotes intrinsic motivation.</p>

                 <h2>3. Promote Deep Learning</h2>
                 <p>Compassionate Teaching acknowledges that the process of learning is dynamic, not a fixed destination. This entails moving beyond external motivations like grades and focusing on intrinsic factors that contribute to understanding and potentially mastering the content, as opposed to mere memorization. Utilizing low-stakes assignments, such as entrance and exit tickets, proves to be invaluable for reinforcing concepts and facilitating continuous practice.</p>
                 <p><a href="https://adelphi.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=86672bbb-0775-4e8b-a38e-b0f20128a9c3" target="_blank">Supportive and constructive feedback</a>, as noted, serves as a guide for students rather than just an assessment tool. By breaking down complex content into manageable chunks, there is a promotion of comprehension, recognizing that the pace of learning varies for each student. The overarching theme is to emphasize the journey towards the destination, fostering a more meaningful learning experience for every student.</p>

                 <h2>4. First Week Recommendations</h2>
                 <p>To incorporate Compassionate Teaching effectively, begin by focusing on the initial days of your course—the very first week sets the tone for the entire semester. Compassionate Teaching proposes an additional/alternative approach to the conventional syllabus introduction. Instructors, in addition to following that traditional protocol, can pique curiosity by presenting intriguing facets of the course content.</p>
                 <p>Humanizing oneself through the sharing of personal learning barriers and stressors establishes a profound connection with students, fostering empathy and understanding. Addressing each student by name, including their pronouns and pronunciations, contributes to a sense of belonging. Additionally, emphasizing policies related to flexibility, such as allowing choices in assignments and dropping the lowest grade, communicates to students that their unique backgrounds and experiences are valued. This, in turn, cultivates a sense of community and, ideally, enhances engagement.</p>
                 <p>To further foster and exemplify Compassionate Teaching to your new students, consider incorporating icebreakers and group activities. These methods help break down barriers, encouraging interaction and collaboration among students. Additionally, demonstrating a commitment to their overall well-being beyond the classroom involves informing students about available campus resources.</p>
                 <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EXZ4axbl1CUIsmDwJPDAh_v1aU0YO8WLT7h5fklF0i4/copy" target="_blank">Conducting a general survey</a> is another effective strategy. This survey yields insights into the diverse needs and preferences of the student cohort, enabling instructors to tailor their approach and better meet the individual needs of their students.</p>
                 <p>Instructors can cultivate an environment conducive to both academic success and holistic student development by embracing flexibility in assignments, fostering open communication, prioritizing dynamic learning strategies, and adopting thoughtful recommendations for the first day and week. In an educational landscape that requires adaptability, Compassionate Teaching emerges as a guiding philosophy for educators committed to the success and well-being of their students.</p>
