Are you considering incorporating small group discussions into your lessons but afraid that doing so will encourage students to go off-task? Or that students won’t engage at all?

This workshop is designed to inform faculty of different discussion protocols that align with your course learning objectives and will not only keep students engaged and on task, but also deepen their understanding of the content and encourage critical thinking.

Transform your course content into captivating narratives that engage and inspire your students! In this workshop, you'll learn how to structure lessons as compelling stories that resonate. We'll explore techniques to identify key concepts in your curriculum and craft narratives that ignite curiosity and foster emotional connections. By incorporating storytelling, you'll create a more immersive learning experience, helping students relate to the material and boosting their motivation to participate. Join us to explore how turning your course material into narratives can revolutionize the way you engage and inspire your students.

 
Flipping the Discussion
Monday, November 25 ❘ 1:00 PM
Virtual Via Zoom
Zoom Registration
Kevin Mobbs, Sr. Instructional Designer, FCPE
Jen Southard, Instructional Designer, FCPE
The common instruction, “After posting your response, reply to at least two of your peers,” is often seen in online and hybrid courses. However, its effectiveness in fostering meaningful engagement and learning may be limited. Why do discussions sometimes fall flat, and how can we design them to spark genuine interaction?

In this workshop, we’ll explore how to flip discussions—a dynamic strategy to revitalize conversations and deepen students' connections with course material. Through practical examples, you’ll see firsthand how this approach can transform class discussions, making them more interactive, engaging, and purposeful.

Whether you teach online, hybrid, or in-person, flipping discussions is a simple yet impactful way to enhance participation and promote active learning among your students.
