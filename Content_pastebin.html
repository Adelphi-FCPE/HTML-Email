<p>The Faculty Center for Professional Excellence is pleased to offer the 10-day Online Academy: Course Development Intensive this Summer. The start date for the Online Academy will be June 17; the program will run on weekdays through <strong>June 28</strong>.</p>
<p>The Online Academy has been designed to run as an <strong>asynchronous</strong> faculty professional development program, with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Daily readings, activities, and assignments which were created as applied practice in course development for online or hybrid sections.</li>
    <li>Optional synchronous workshops/labs that address online pedagogy, technology, and accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The Online Academy allowed me to conceptualize a course fully but then take apart each piece (like a puzzle), learn about it, analyze it, and see how it all fits together. Putting in the time through the Academy made for a much smoother course.</blockquote>

<p>Faculty participants will be cohorted in small groups to facilitate community building and collaboration. The cohorts will be led by FCPE Instructional Designers.</p>
<p>Upon successful completion of the Online Academy (85% or better), participants will be awarded a certificate featuring credentials backed by Accredible.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>“Like many faculty members, I enrolled in the Online Academy during the early days of the pandemic because I needed to modify my class content for online and remote teaching. Even as I teach in-person classes now, I am able to thoughtfully design online activities, lesson plans, and assessments that support in-person instruction... I highly recommend faculty taking this course.”</p>
    <p><strong>— Anthony Dotterman, Associate Teaching Professor Adelphi Plus, College of Arts and Sciences</strong></p>
